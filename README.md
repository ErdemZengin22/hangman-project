# Hangman Terminal Game - MidTerm Project - AlbanyCanCode - JSFunSpring2023
Hi, I'm Erdem Zengin

This is my first project at Albany Can Code.

In order to complete this project, I had to do long hours of research and method development. Compiling the answers to questions such as how to design a game, what steps are required, what functions should be written, when they should be called etc. was the most difficult part of the project. This is my very first javaScript project after all :)

In this readme file I will try to explain every part of this process and what my code does. I like reading perfectly explained codes and I tried my best to explain everything whats going on in the code.

More updates and details are coming to this file soon...

## Purpose Of The Project

The aim of the project is to code a very simple text-based hangman game that can be played in the terminal using only JavaScript.
